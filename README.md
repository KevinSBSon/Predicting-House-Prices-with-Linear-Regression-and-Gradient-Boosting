# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Linear-Regression-and-Gradient-Boosting



Predicting house prices accurately is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of the housing market. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been widely used for house price prediction. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of Ridge, Lasso linear regression, and Gradient Boosting for house price prediction on a Kaggle competition dataset. We first perform exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to prepare the data. Then, we train and evaluate models using Ridge, Lasso linear regression, and Gradient Boosting with hyperparameter tuning. Our experimental results show that Gradient Boosting outperforms Ridge and Lasso linear regression in terms of predictive accuracy, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0129. However, Lasso linear regression and Ridge provide interpretable feature importance scores, which can be useful for feature selection and model interpretation. Our study highlights the importance of choosing appropriate machine learning techniques for house price prediction, depending on the specific requirements of the application.
